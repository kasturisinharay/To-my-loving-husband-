    <h1>To My Loving Husband</h1>
    <p>Your silence has taught me something I had only ever read in books — that if you can't love alone, you don’t deserve to love at all.</p>
    <p>I regret placing too much on your shoulders when all you needed was simple kindness. My burdens are mine to carry, yours only to share — and yet, I let my spontaneity come at your expense. I want you to know: your struggles are seen, your silence heard. I want to walk with you — all the way — even if it means letting go of my own anger, fear, and stormy emotions.</p>
    <p>Somewhere in all this, I found a calm I never had before. Life isn’t fair — but that doesn't give me the right to hurt you, the very person who makes me dream.</p>
    <p>You once taught me: <em>when the water rises above your chin, the only thing that matters is to keep breathing.</em> And so I did. When you disappeared from my life without a trace, I was lost for a while. I couldn’t imagine life without you. But I gathered myself, piece by piece, not just for me — for <strong>us</strong>.</p>
    <p>I started from the beginning, retracing our story in reverse, slowly and with care. I’ve always been drawn to your intelligence, your striking presence. You’re still my love at first sight. And then I realized: nothing’s really changed. You’re still that man at the gate, at the wedding, at the deadly winter door, in the bus, at the train station, at the airport, in the corridor — waiting.</p>
    <p>You’ve always waited for me. And now, I will wait for you. No matter how long it takes, no matter where I am. You will reach out. However distant you may seem, I know — you’ll find your way back to me.</p>

    <div class="signature">
      — Yours, always
